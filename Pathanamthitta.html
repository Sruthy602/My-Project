        <p class="card-text"> At a distance of 26 km from Pathanamthitta, Perunthenaruvi Waterfall is a wonderful waterfall situated at Vechoochira village in Kerala. It is one of the famous Pathanamthitta sightseeing places, and among the major waterfalls near Trivandrum.

            Situated in the forest region of Sabarimala, Perunthenaruvi allures tourists with its breathtakingly beautiful waterfalls and the dazzling stream that flows to merge with the sacred Pamba River. The locality is the home field of beehives which have bestowed the place with the title Perunthenaruvi meaning 'The Honey Stream'.
            
            There are two waterfalls at Perunthenaruvi - the 300 feet Panamkudantha and the 200 feet Padivathil - both of these originate from the dense woods of Sabarimala. The stream gushes further beyond through the rocky bed to unite with the holy Pamba. This is a wonderful place to spend few hours swimming and playing in the water and enjoying the spectacular views.
            
            The main route to this waterfall starts from Ranni - Athikkayam - Kudamurutty - Perunthenaruvi. It is connected by bus service with Pathanamthitta. It is close to the main road and demands 20 minutes of trekking to reach the place.</p> </div>
