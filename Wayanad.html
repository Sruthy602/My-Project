It is said that 'Banasura' undertook severe penance on the top of the hills. Banasura hill is the third largest peak in the Western Ghats.

            The dam here was constructed on behalf of the Banasurasagar project in 1979, to support the Kakkayam Hydroelectric power project to meet the water demand for irrigation and drinking purposes. The dam, located around 21 km away from Kalpetta is a beautiful tourist destination in Wayanad. Banasura dam is made up of massive stacks of stones and boulders.

These islands with the Banasura hills in the background are a visual treat for those who visit the dam and its premises. Because of this peculiarity, tourists are attracted towards this destination. The dam is very close to Karalad Lake, another tourist hotspot in Wayanad.</p> </div>
