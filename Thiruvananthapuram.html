  <p> Thiruvananthapuram (or Trivandrum) is the capital of the southern Indian state of Kerala. It's distinguished by its British colonial architecture and many art galleries. It’s also home to Kuthira Malika (or Puthen Malika)Palace, adorned with carved horses and displaying collections related to the Travancore royal family, whose regional capital was here from the 18th–20th centuries.Thiruananthapuram, the jewel in the emerald necklace that Kerala is for the Indian sub-continent, must surely have Parasuramanbeen a “must see” destination for ages, long before National Geographic Traveller classified it as one. Surely long before Sage Parasurama , according to local legend, threw his divine battle axe from Kanyakumari to Gokarnam to west Kerala, God’s own land, from the Varuna the sea god; before the times of Mahabali the democratic and just ruler of this wonderful land who was sent down to the netherworld through deceit. It doesnt take any flights of fancy to imagine that this land fired the imaginations of intrepid travellers and explorers like Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Marco Polo, Fa Hien etc.</p></div>

        <p class="card-text">Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is one of the famous places to visit. This holy shrine is one of the 108 abodes of Lord Vishnu. A large number of devotees throng the temple on multiple occasions.

            The place of worship has lent its names to the capital city as ‘Thiru’ ‘Anantha’ ‘Puram’, which means Sacred Abode of Lord Anantha Padmanabha. Dravidian style of architecture is prominent in this holy structure.
            
            The chief attraction is the deity of Padmanabhaswamy, enshrined in a reclining posture. However, the main deity remains that of Lord Vishnu and his heavenly consorts namely, Sridevi and Bhudevi. The sacred idol is covered with a special ayurveda mixture that helps in keeping the plaster intact and clean. Devotees donate a large sum of money and precious articles in this temple. The assets are believed to be value around 90,000 crores.  The invaluable donations are kept safe in 6 different cellars.
            
            Padmanabhaswamy Temple should definitely be included in the itinerary of the places to visit in Trivandrum. Indeed, the temple remains impeccable in appearance and religious sentiments attached to it.</p> </div>
