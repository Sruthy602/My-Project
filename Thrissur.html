  <p>   Thrissur, formerly Trichur, city, central Kerala state, southwestern India. The city is located 12 miles (19 km) inland from the Arabian Sea coast on an extensive lagoon system.Thrissur, a commercial and cultural centre, is considered to be the oldest city on the west coast of India. Its name means “small sacred place.” The city is built around a hillock topped by the Vadakkumnathan Temple (dedicated to Shiva), the focus of an annual festival. A city of many faiths, Thrissur is also home to some of the oldest mosques and churches in the country. Its industries include cotton weaving, rice and oilseed milling, soap manufacturing, and sawmilling. The city is also a retail hub for the state of Kerala, and is home to some of the largest jewellery and textile businesses in the region. Thrissur has colleges affiliated with the University of Calicut, a museum, and zoological gardens. The city has good road and rail connections with the rest of Kerala and with the interior.The area surrounding Thrissur lies largely on the coastal plain except in the southeast, where it overlaps the hills of the Western Ghats. Agriculture is important in the region—rice and coconuts are the main crops</p></div>

        <p class="card-text">Built after a rather Dutch style architecture, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace is a sight to behold. Finding its name in almost every list of Thrissur tourist places, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace was rebuilt in the place of Vadakkekara Palace in the year 1795 by the then King Ramavarma Thampuram of Cochin.

            In the year 2005, the palace was converted into a museum that now showcases a number of relics and really old antiques. A favourite one amongst several art admirers, the two-storeyed complex has high roofs, thicker than usual walls, and Italian Marble on the floor, making it a place right out of a traveller’s dream.</p>  </div>
