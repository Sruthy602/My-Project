    <p> Kannur is most renowned for the Theyyam performances in its temples. This magnificent art form plays an integral part in the culture of this Northern Kerala district. Formerly known as Cannanore, Marco Polo christened it a ‘Great Emporium Of Spice Trade’. Kannur has, since time immemorial, been hailed as an influential sea port. Legend has it that it had interactions and trade relations with the rest of the world since the time of King Solomon to the Greeks, Arabs and Romans. It has a plethora of forts, temples, beaches and wildlife sanctuaries that regularly attract visitors. Major festivals and events are held throughout the year and this is among the best places in Kerala to spend your vacation in.</p>     </div>

          <p class="card-text">   A gigantic fort located 3 km from Kannur, in triangular shape and built of laterite, Fort St. Angelos is also known as the Kannur Fort and was built by the Portuguese in 1505. The credit of building the fort goes to the first Portuguese Viceroy of India, Dom Francisco De Almeida.

            The fort has seen many seizures and rules over the years. First, the Dutch captured it from the Portuguese rulers, then sold to the local ruler of Kannur, but later the British gained control over the fort and turned into one of their military stops in south India. Even today, it stands as a pride fort not showing any signs of its earlier conquests.
            
            It is a protected monument today owing to its historical significance and the Archaeological Survey of India has taken over the fort for its conservation. From the fort, you can get a great view of the surrounding fishing bay and the sea.</p>     </div>

            It also has many plantations of cashew nut, eucalyptus and others. Earlier, the region belonged to many private owners but it was taken over by the state government in 1984 to set up the Wildlife Sanctuary to protect the exotic flora and fauna of the region.
            
            The Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary is home to many wildlife species, including 23 species of mammals, 22 species of reptiles, 188 species of birds and more.
