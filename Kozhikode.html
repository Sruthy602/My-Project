<p>Kozhikode is the largest city in the region known as Malabar and was the capital of the British-era Malabar district. In antiquity and the medieval period, Kozhikode was dubbed the City of Spices for its role as the major trading point for Indian spices. It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins). The port at Kozhikode acted as the gateway to medieval South Indian coast for the Chinese, the Arabs, the Portuguese, the Dutch and finally the British. According to data compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009 on residences, earnings and investments, Kozhikode was ranked the second best city in India to live in.</p>

    <img src="./pictures/Srikanteshwara temple.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="">
    <p class="card-text"> On your visit to Kerala, you must add this temple to your list of places to see in Kozhikode.   More than a hundred years old, this temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is a must-visit pilgrimage of Hindus. Apart from Lord Shiva, you can worship Lord Ganapathy, the serpent Gods, and Lord Krishna.

        There is a much widely circulated folklore regarding the temple and its construction by the Maharaja of Travancore. Moreover, the Shivaratri festival is celebrated in much gaiety and fervor here. Apart from that, the moment you arrive in the temple, you will be engulfed by its tranquil atmosphere and both devotees and visitors are welcome inside it. Further, take time to explore the beautiful architecture and some quiet moments near the pond. </p> </div>

  <div class="card-header"><h5>Thusharagiri Fall</h5></div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <img src="./pictures/Thusharagiri fall.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="">
    <p class="card-text">Enjoy the breathtaking beauty of Thusharagiri Fall when you pay a visit to Kozhikode.  Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet at this point to create the Chalipuzzha River. The river further trifurcates to create three waterfalls and the free-falling water creates a mist, thus giving the name “Thusharagiri”.

        This place has a lovely view all around and you get plenty of activities to indulge in. You may go for trekking, or enjoy rock-climbing. You can also take a break to visit the wildlife sanctuaries or sit on the banks of the river to enjoy the waterfalls. The lush green forest and cool water of the streams all around add to your enjoyment. A word of caution though, people with a faint heart should avoid the place because it is nature at its wildest best.</p> </div>
